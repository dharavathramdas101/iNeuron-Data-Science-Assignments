        "#### Ans:\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to represent text data as a vector. In one-hot encoding, each word in the vocabulary is assigned a unique vector. The vector for a word is a binary vector, where each element represents the presence or absence of the word. The length of the vector is equal to the size of the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if the vocabulary contains the words \"the\", \"cat\", \"dog\", and \"house\", then the one-hot encoding for the word \"the\" would be the vector [1, 0, 0, 0]. The one-hot encoding for the word \"cat\" would be the vector [0, 1, 0, 0], and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding is a simple and straightforward way to represent text data. However, it has some limitations. One limitation is that it does not take into account the meaning of words. For example, the one-hot encodings for the words \"cat\" and \"dog\" are the same, even though these words have different meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another limitation of one-hot encoding is that it can be computationally expensive to represent large vocabularies. This is because the number of possible vectors is equal to 2^n, where n is the size of the vocabulary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite its limitations, one-hot encoding is a useful technique for representing text data. It is a simple and straightforward way to represent the presence or absence of words in a vocabulary. One-hot encoding is often used as a preprocessing step for other NLP tasks, such as text classification and sentiment analysis.\n",

        "Sure. TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. It is a statistical measure that is used to quantify the importance of a term in a document. TF-IDF is calculated by multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here is an example of how TF-IDF can be used to classify text. Suppose we have a corpus of documents that are about different types of animals. We can use TF-IDF to calculate the importance of each term in each document. For example, the term \"dog\" might have a high TF-IDF score in documents that are about dogs, but a low TF-IDF score in documents that are about cats.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can then use these TF-IDF scores to train a machine learning model to classify new documents. For example, if we have a new document that contains the words \"dog\" and \"walk\", we can use the TF-IDF scores to predict that the document is about dogs.\n",

        "#### Ans:\n",
        "The OOV problem in NLP stands for Out-of-Vocabulary. It occurs when a word in a sentence is not present in the vocabulary of the model. This can happen when the model is trained on a small dataset or when the sentence contains a rare word.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if a model is trained on a dataset of news articles, it is likely to have seen the words \"the\", \"and\", \"of\", and \"to\". However, if the sentence \"I ate a delicious sandwich\" is given to the model, the word \"delicious\" will be OOV.\n",

        "The model may learn to ignore OOV words, which can lead to a loss of information.\n",
        "There are a number of techniques that can be used to address the OOV problem, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "Word embedding: This technique represents each word in the vocabulary as a vector. The vectors are then used to represent the meaning of words. This allows the model to understand the meaning of OOV words even if they are not present in the vocabulary.\n",
        "Subword tokenization: This technique breaks down words into smaller units, such as prefixes, suffixes, and stems. These units are then used to represent the word. This allows the model to understand the meaning of OOV words even if they are not present in the vocabulary.\n",
        "Gaussian smoothing: This technique assigns a small probability to all words, even if they are not present in the vocabulary. This helps to prevent the model from ignoring OOV words.\n",
