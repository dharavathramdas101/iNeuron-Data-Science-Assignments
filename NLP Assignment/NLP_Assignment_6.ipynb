    "**1. What are Vanilla autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vanilla autoencoders are a type of neural network that learns to reconstruct its input data. The network has two parts: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder takes the input data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation. The decoder then takes this representation and reconstructs the original input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a vanilla autoencoder could be used to compress an image into a smaller number of pixels. The encoder would take the image as input and compress it into a smaller representation. The decoder would then take this representation and reconstruct the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. What are Sparse autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that is trained to produce sparse representations of its input data. A sparse representation is one where most of the values are zero. This can be useful for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to reduce the number of features in a dataset without losing too much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sparse autoencoder could be used to compress an image by removing the noise from the image. The encoder would take the image as input and compress it into a smaller representation. The decoder would then take this representation and reconstruct the original image, but with the noise removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. What are Denoising autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoising autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that is trained on noisy data. The goal of a denoising autoencoder is to learn to reconstruct the original input data from the noisy data. This can be useful for tasks such as image restoration, where the goal is to remove noise from an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a denoising autoencoder could be used to restore a corrupted image. The encoder would take the corrupted image as input and compress it into a lower-dimensional representation. The decoder would then take this representation and reconstruct the original image, but without the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. What are Convolutional autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that uses convolutional layers. Convolutional layers are a type of neural network layer that is specifically designed for processing data that has a grid-like structure, such as images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional autoencoders can be used for tasks such as image compression, image restoration, and image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a convolutional autoencoder could be used to compress an image by learning to identify the important features in the image. The encoder would take the image as input and compress it into a lower-dimensional representation. The decoder would then take this representation and reconstruct the original image, but with the important features preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. What are Stacked autoencoders**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacked autoencoders are a type of autoencoder that consists of multiple autoencoders stacked on top of each other. Each autoencoder in the stack learns to reconstruct the output of the autoencoder below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stacked autoencoders can be used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a stacked autoencoder could be used to classify images by learning to identify the important features in the images. The first autoencoder in the stack would learn to compress the images into a lower-dimensional representation. The second autoencoder would then learn to reconstruct the output of the first autoencoder. This process would continue until the final autoencoder in the stack learns to classify the images.\n",

    "\n",
    "LSTM autoencoders can be used to generate sentences by first training the autoencoder on a corpus of text. The autoencoder will learn to reconstruct the input text, but it will also learn the statistical relationships between words. Once the autoencoder is trained, it can be used to generate new sentences by starting with a random word and then using the autoencoder to predict the next word. The process is repeated until the desired length of the sentence is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an LSTM autoencoder could be trained on a corpus of news articles. Once the autoencoder is trained, it could be used to generate new news articles by starting with a random word and then using the autoencoder to predict the next word. The process would continue until the autoencoder generated a sentence that is the desired length.\n",

    "**7. Explain Extractive summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Extractive summarization is a text summarization technique that involves identifying the most important parts of a text and then extracting those parts to create a summary. This can be done by using a variety of techniques, such as keyword extraction, sentence ranking, and sentence compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an extractive summarization algorithm could be used to summarize a news article by identifying the most important keywords in the article and then extracting the sentences that contain those keywords. The algorithm could also rank the sentences in the article based on their importance and then extract the top-ranked sentences to create the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Explain Abstractive summarization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstractive summarization is a text summarization technique that involves generating a new text that summarizes the original text. This can be done by understanding the meaning of the original text and then generating new text that expresses that meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an abstractive summarization algorithm could be used to summarize a news article by understanding the meaning of the article and then generating a new text that expresses that meaning. The algorithm could do this by using a variety of techniques, such as natural language processing and machine learning.\n",

    "**9. Explain Beam search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Beam search is a technique used to generate text by considering a set of possible next words and then selecting the word that is most likely to lead to a good summary. The beam search algorithm starts with a set of possible next words and then iteratively adds new words to the set based on their likelihood of leading to a good summary. The process continues until the beam search algorithm reaches the desired length of the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a beam search algorithm could be used to generate a new news article by starting with a random word and then using the beam search algorithm to predict the next word. The process would continue until the beam search algorithm generated a sentence that is the desired length.\n",

    "**10. Explain Length normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Length normalization is a technique used to improve the quality of text summarization by penalizing summaries that are too long or too short. This is done by assigning a lower score to summaries that are too long or too short, and a higher score to summaries that are of a more appropriate length.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a length normalization algorithm could be used to summarize a news article by first generating a summary of the desired length. The algorithm would then penalize the summary if it is too long or too short, and would give it a higher score if it is of a more appropriate length.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Explain Coverage normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coverage normalization is a technique used to improve the quality of text summarization by penalizing summaries that do not cover all of the important information in the original text. This is done by assigning a lower score to summaries that do not cover all of the important information, and a higher score to summaries that do cover all of the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a coverage normalization algorithm could be used to summarize a news article by first generating a summary of the desired length. The algorithm would then penalize the summary if it does not cover all of the important information in the article, and would give it a higher score if it does cover all of the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**12. Explain ROUGE metric evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE metric evaluation is a technique used to evaluate the quality of text summarization by comparing the generated summary to the original text. ROUGE metric evaluation calculates a score that measures the similarity between the two texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ROUGE metric evaluation could be used to evaluate the quality of a summary of a news article. The ROUGE metric evaluation algorithm would compare the summary to the original article and calculate a score that measures the similarity between the two texts. A higher score indicates that the summary is more similar to the original article, and therefore of higher quality."
